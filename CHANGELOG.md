## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2024-02-03

## [0.1.1] - 2024-02-03

## [0.1.0] - 2024-02-03

### Added

- Added cargo feature `hook-command` to enable hook based on shell commands (enabled by default).
- Added cargo feature `hook-notify` to enable hook based on system notifications (enabled by default).
- Added `config.sample.toml` at <https://github.com/soywod/comodoro/blob/master/config.sample.toml>.

### Changed

- Moved top-level commands related to client to the `timer` subcommand.
- Improved configuration API:

  | Before                  | After                              |
  |-------------------------|------------------------------------|
  | `[example]`             | `[presets.example]`                |
  | `tcp-host`              | `tcp.host`                         |
  | `tcp-port`              | `tcp.port`                         |
  | `on-time-begin = "cmd"` | `hooks.on-timer-begin.cmd = "cmd"` |

  The main purpose is to improve error diagnostic line numbers, see <https://github.com/toml-rs/toml/issues/589>.

## [0.0.10] - 2023-10-09

### Changed

- Upgraded nixpkgs channel from `22.11` to `23.05`.
- Upgraded cargo dependencies.
- Improved documentations.

## [0.0.9] - 2023-06-24

### Added

- Added preset option `preset` to get preconfigured timer. Available options: `pomodoro`, `52/17`.
- Added preset option `cycles-count` to control how the timer loops. `0` means infinite, whereas any integer makes the timer stop automatically after n loops.
- Added preset option `timer-precision` to customize the timer format. Available options: `second`, `minute` (default), `hour`.

## [0.0.8] - 2023-05-18

### Changed

- Changed the aim of the project. The timer is not Pomodoro-specific anymore, it became generic (which allows you to turn it into a Pomodoro timer, or whatever).
- Changed hooks name from `timer-started-hook` to `on-timer-start` and so on.

### Changed

- Replaced `pimalaya` by `pimalaya-pomodoro`.

### Fixed
