Comodoro is slowly migrating away from GitHub. The new bug tracker is
now on sourcehut. You can submit an issue either by:

- Sending an email at ~soywod/pimalaya@todo.sr.ht (it is the simplest
  since you do not need to create any account)
- Submitting the form at https://todo.sr.ht/~soywod/pimalaya (you need
  a free sourcehut account)
