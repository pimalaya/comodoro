## Concept

Comodoro is a socket-based CLI timer following the principles of the Pomodoro
Technique. It helps you fight procrastination by spliting work times from break
times.

The timer is divided into 6 consecutive periods that repeat indefinitely:

1. Work time (25 min)
2. Short break time (5 min)
3. Work time (25 min)
4. Short break time (5 min)
5. Work time (25 min)
6. Long break time (15 min)

The timer uses Unix sockets. Clients who connect to it receive the timer in
real time. This way, the timer can be integrated in all kind of workflow.

## Installation

### From binaries

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soywod/comodoro/master/install.sh | bash
```

*Note: Linux, MacOS and Windows are supported. See the [releases
section](https://github.com/soywod/comodoro/releases).*

### From sources

First install [`opam`](https://opam.ocaml.org/):

```bash
sh <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)
```

Then build from sources:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soywod/comodoro.git
cd comodoro
opam install .
opam exec -- dune build
```

*Note: The executable is available at `_build/default/bin/main.exe`.*

## Configuration

Edit `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/comodoro/config.toml`:

```toml
# Work time in minutes.
work-time = 25

# Short break time in minutes.
short-break-time = 5

# Long break time in minutes.
long-break-time = 15

# Commands to execute when starting the timer.
# Should be a list of string.
exec-on-start = []

# Commands to execute when entering break times (short or long).
# Should be a list of string.
exec-on-break = []

# Commands to execute when re-entering work times (except the first one).
# Should be a list of string.
exec-on-resume = []

# Commands to execute when stopping the timer.
# Should be a list of string.
exec-on-stop = []
```

*Note: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is usually set to `~/.config`.*

*Note: read more about the TOML file format
[here](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml).*

## Usage

### Start

Start the timer.

```bash
comodoro start
```

### Stop

Stop the timer.

```bash
comodoro stop
```

### Watch

Watch the timer (blocking).

comodoro watch
```

## Integration

### [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)

```config
[bar/top]
modules-right = comodoro

[module/comodoro]
type = custom/script
exec = comodoro watch 
label = %output%
tail = true
click-left = if [ -e /tmp/comodoro.pid ]; then comodoro stop; else comodoro start; fi
```

## Contributing

Git commit messages follow the [Angular
Convention](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153), but
contain only a subject.

  > Use imperative, present tense: ‚Äúchange‚Äù not ‚Äúchanged‚Äù nor
  > ‚Äúchanges‚Äù<br>Don't capitalize first letter<br>No dot (.) at the end

Code should be as clean as possible, variables and functions use the snake case
convention. A line should be as short as possible to improve readability.

Tests should be added for each new functionality. Be sure to run tests before
proposing a pull request.
